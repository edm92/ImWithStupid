## Project Setup

_To use the game run the batch file relevant to you. This game uses an old version of LWJGL and to run the game on Linux or Mac you'll need to download the relevant dlls (sorry)._ 

1. _The game is build using the LWJGL Lightweight Java Game Library and the relevant jars are packaged in the lib folder_
2. _To launch the game see the batch files for how to link with the relevant windows dlls (also packaged)_
